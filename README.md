UFO Analysis

Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to build upon Danaâ€™s UFO analysis. The original analysis worked as intended and this time I will provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, the new analysis will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. I will present these new functions to Dana.

##Results
The new enhanced webpage allows you to search for more criteria than the original webpage. This time we can filter by many different criteria instead of just the date. As the below image shows you have many different criteria you can filter upon. If you want to know if there were any sightings on a certain date, in certain city located in specific time you get all the results that come up with this criterion. You can even snapshot by comments you want to see in your search and the object type. The different filters are represented in the image below. Enter the fields that you are interested in, and your result will populate. This analysis can help you be as specific or as general a user wants their search results to be. In my test analysis I searched for UFO sightings on 1/1/2010 in Fresno, Ca USA. Just by entering that much information my one result for Fresno populated on the right-hand side (also shown below)
