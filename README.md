UFO Analysis

Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to build upon Dana’s UFO analysis. The original analysis worked as intended and this time I will provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, the new analysis will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. I will present these new functions to Dana.

##Results
The new enhanced webpage allows you to search for more criteria than the original webpage. This time we can filter by many different criteria instead of just the date. As the below image shows you have many different criteria you can filter upon. If you want to know if there were any sightings on a certain date, in certain city located in specific time you get all the results that come up with this criterion. You can even snapshot by comments you want to see in your search and the object type. The different filters are represented in the image below. Enter the fields that you are interested in, and your result will populate. This analysis can help you be as specific or as general a user wants their search results to be. In my test analysis I searched for UFO sightings on 1/1/2010 in Fresno, Ca USA. Just by entering that much information my one result for Fresno populated on the right-hand side (also shown below)

Summary
In summary, I think this webpage has come a long way from the original analysis. I still think further work could be done. One of the drawbacks of the current analysis is the data we have only appears to be for the year 2010. Now that we have done so much research and analysis on UFO’s I would be curious about more recent data events. Of course, this would require Dana to present a much larger data.js file to filter several years. 

One thing I would have been really interested in for further development is to add another filter where instead of entering criteria in the filter search, I could just click on the date button, or the city button and sort ascending or descending information that way. Sort by most recent to last date or sort he cities by alphabetical order. I think this would be interesting if you wanted a high-level overview and was skeptic and wanted to see if UFO sightings was actually a phenomenon. 

Another feature for further development would be images. It would really help drive home the point of these analysis if there were actual images of the lights or UFO sightings. If there was video that was also attached to the search. There have been many news stories over the years of video footage of flashing lights. This video or any images would be really strong data and possible help skeptics like V.isulize see the information for herself. This analysis made a believer out of me, what about you?
